### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alex

[![Github](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/alexaandru?label=Follow&style=social)](https://github.com/alexaandru)

I love [Go](https://golang.org), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) & lately [~~Lua~~](http://www.lua.org/) [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/).

Programming since 1999 (technically, since 1995 - when I had my 1st programming class at the Faculty of Economic Sciences, using **Turbo Pascal**).

I worked over the years both as a programmer (in **HTML** (started as a webmaster in 1999), **JavaScript**, **Perl**, **PHP**, **Delphi**, **Ruby** (and **Rails**) and finally **Go** since 2014 and counting!) as well as a systems/network admin (managed all the fun stuff: **routing / SMTP / DNS / DHCP / FTP / MYSQL / LDAP / NFS / IPtables** & more, even used **Cfengine** to manage servers before **Terraform**, **Puppet** or **Chef** even existed).

I'm a sucker for learning, in general, not just IT related. I love bioinformatics, microbiology, genetics, virology, civil engineering, anthropology, history, math, Jack London's writings & much more.

When I'm not around my computer chances are I am cycling or powerlifting.
